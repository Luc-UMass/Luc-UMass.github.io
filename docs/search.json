Prerequisites are\n\na solid working knowledge of probablilty (e.g. Math 605, STAT 607 or equivalent).\na solid working knowedge of analysis (at least Math 523 or equivalent) and some basic linear algebra.\n\nsome mathematical maturity\n\nIn Math 606 we will cover various aspects of stochastic processes. One of the main goal in the class is to develop a “probabilist intuition and way of thinking”. We will present some proofs and we will skip some others in order to provide a reasonably broad range of topics, concepts and techniques. We emphasize examples both in discrete and continuous time from a wide range of disciplines and with an eye on numerical implementation. Among the topics treated in the class are\n\nDiscrete time Markov chains on discrete spaces. Definition and basic properties, classification of states (positive recurrence, recurrence and transience), stationary distribution and limit theorems, analysis of transient behavior, optimal stopping, Monte-Carlo Markov chains.\nContinuous-Time Markov chains. Poisson Process, Birth and Death Process, and Queueing models. Renewal processes and semi-Markov processes.\nMartingales and applications\nBrownian motion and applications.",

To get started here are the slides for Markov chain chapter from last year\nMarkov chain slides.\nI will post a new updated version as the semester moves on.\nI have been inspired by many textbooks when preparing my class, see the list below. I strongly suggest you pick a textbook and spend time regularly reading from it, in parallel to the class. The book by Lawler is a marvelous short introduction which covers most topic in the class and is highly recommended as a first read. The books by Resnick and Bremaud are a bit more advanced and are both excellent as well. The topics of simulation and Markov chain is well covered in the books by Ross, Madras, and Rubinstein and Kroese. The book by David A. Levin, Yuval Peres, and Elizabeth L. Wilmer is a great book to learn modern Markov chain techniques.\n\nMarkov Chains Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues, 2nd edition (2007) by Pierre Bremaud, Springer.\nIntroduction to Stochastic Processes, 2nd edition (2007) by Gregory F.

Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent, see http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/.
