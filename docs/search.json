Prerequisites are\n\na solid working knowledge of probablilty (e.g. Math 605, STAT 607 or equivalent).\na solid working knowedge of analysis (at least Math 523 or equivalent) and some basic linear algebra.\n\nsome mathematical maturity\n\nIn Math 606 we will cover various aspects of stochastic processes. One of the main goal in the class is to develop a “probabilist intuition and way of thinking”. We will present some proofs and we will skip some others in order to provide a reasonably broad range of topics, concepts and techniques. We emphasize examples both in discrete and continuous time from a wide range of disciplines and with an eye on numerical implementation. Among the topics treated in the class are\n\nDiscrete time Markov chains on discrete spaces. Definition and basic properties, classification of states (positive recurrence, recurrence and transience), stationary distribution and limit theorems, analysis of transient behavior, optimal stopping, Monte-Carlo Markov chains.\nContinuous-Time Markov chains. Poisson Process, Birth and Death Process, and Queueing models. Renewal processes and semi-Markov processes.\nMartingales and applications\nBrownian motion and applications.",

I am somewhat flexible about topics but I will provide a list to choose from. Talk to me about your ideas. You should select a topic by the end of February. I will expect you to create a poster for a group presentation at the end of the class.\nHere is a list of topics\n\nMixing time of Markov chains: several projects can be carved out starting from the book Markov chain and mixing times by David A. Levin, Yuval Peres, and Elizabeth L. Wilmer.\nHidden Markov models\n\nContinous-time Markov chains for chemical reactions networks. Widely used in biological and biochemical applications.\nQueueing models.\nMarkov chains and chaotic dynamical systems. Deterministic chaotic systems can often be described using Markov chains. Learn how to do this.\nLyapunov function techniques to analyze Markov chain. Useful for Markov chains with continuous and non-compact state spaces. Good topics for an anal;ysis minded student\nQuantum Markov chains.

I think it is a really good book to learn the basic ides and concepts, and you can move on to more comprehensive textbooks next.\nI have been inspired by many textbooks over the years when preparing my class, see the list below. I strongly suggest you pick a textbook and spend time regularly reading from it, in parallel to the class. The book by Lawler is a marvelous short introduction which covers most topic in the class and is highly recommended as a first read. The books by Resnick and Bremaud are a bit more advanced and are both excellent as well. The topics of simulation and Markov chain is well covered in the books by Ross, Madras, and Rubinstein and Kroese. The book by David A. Levin, Yuval Peres, and Elizabeth L. Wilmer is a great book to learn modern Markov chain techniques.\n\nMarkov Chains Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues, 2nd edition (2007) by Pierre Bremaud, Springer.\nIntroduction to Stochastic Processes, 2nd edition (2007) by Gregory F.

Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent, see http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/. Seeking answers from websites like Chegg, Discord, etc is a clear violation of the academic honesty policy, while submitting course materials to these sites or similar ones is a violation of the instructor’s copyright.",

Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent, see http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty/.

One of the main goal in the class is to develop a “probabilist intuition and way of thinking”. We will present some proofs and we will skip some others in order to provide a reasonably broad range of topics, concepts and techniques. We emphasize examples both in discrete and continuous time from a wide range of disciplines and with an eye on numerical implementation. Among the topics treated in the class are\n\nDiscrete time Markov chains on discrete spaces. Definition and basic properties, classification of states (positive recurrence, recurrence and transience), stationary distribution and limit theorems, analysis of transient behavior, optimal stopping, Monte-Carlo Markov chains.\nContinuous-Time Markov chains. Poisson Process, Birth and Death Process, and Queueing models. Renewal processes and semi-Markov processes.\nMartingales and applications\nBrownian motion and applications.",

    "text": "Syllabus\nThis is the first part of a (newly renamed) 2-semester graduate sequence Math605-Math606 which leads to the Stochastics qualifying exam. Prerequisites are\n\na solid working knowledge of undergaduate probablilty (at least STAT 515 or STAT 607 or equivalent).\na good working knowedge of analysis and proofs (at least Math 523 or equivalent)\nsome mathematical maturity\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nOne can do many interesting applications with undergaduate probability (i.e. probability without measure theory) but at some point one needs to up your game. The goal of the class is to bring your probability knowledge to the next level so that you can tackle more sophisticated problems and are able to take classes (or read by yourself) on, for exmaple, stochastic processes, stochastic differential equations, statistical learning theory (an important component of machine learning), large deviation theory, optimal transport, information theory, ergodic theory and so on….\nIn Math 605 we will cover some of the foundations of probability.\n\nWhat is a probability space and what are random variables? How do compute their distribution and how do we simulate them?\nConditional probability and independence.\nSome background on measure and integration, and the L^p spaces.\nThe mode of convergences of random variable, almost sure, in probabilty, in distribution.\nCharacteristic and Moment generating functions.\nThe limit theorems: Law of Large numbers and Centra Limit Theorem and Concentration inequalities.\nConditional expectation, Martingale and Martingale convergence theorems.\n\nIn Math 606 we will cover various aspects of stochastic processes. One of the main goal in the class is to develop a “probabilist intuition and way of thinking”. We will present some proofs and we will skip some others in order to provide a reasonably broad range of topics, concepts and techniques. We emphasize examples both in discrete and continuous time from a wide range of disciplines and with an eye on numerical implementation. Among the topics treated in the class are\n\nDiscrete time Markov chains on discrete spaces. Definition and basic properties, classification of states (positive recurrence, recurrence and transience), stationary distribution and limit theorems, analysis of transient behavior, optimal stopping, Monte-Carlo Markov chains.\nContinuous-Time Markov chains. Poisson Process, Birth and Death Process, and Queueing models. Renewal processes and semi-Markov processes.\nMartingales and applications\nBrownian motion and applications.",

I think it is a really good book to learn the basic ides and concepts, and you can move on to more comprehensive textbooks next (let’s say the books by Durrett or Cinlar).\nThere are many other excellent textbooks on probability theory, which are often more comprehensive than our textbook and cover more material and in more depth. I strongly encourage you to pick a book and read it in parallel to the class. This is a really important skill to learn for your future career.

    "text": "Academic Honesty Statement:\nSince the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty is prohibited in all programs of the University. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. Since students are expected to be familiar with this policy and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent http://www.umass.edu/dean_students/codeofconduct/acadhonesty.",
