## Ergodic properties of Markov Processes 

These lectures notes on the ergodic properties of Markov processes (especially with stochastic differential equations in mind) and applications to statistical mechanics 
were written at the occasion of  a summer school on Open Quantum Systems held in Grenoble in the (very hot) summer of 2003.

## Probability and Stochastic Process


The slides/lecture notes have been used when teaching the graduate probability sequence Math 606/06. They are still under construction and will be updated regularly
for the next year or so as I update the curriculum for the classes.  The slides are produced using the reveal.js slides which are part of the [quarto]<https://quarto.org/>
lines of product.
